<h1>Web</h1>
This is my attempt at a web application that would run on a home server, featuring a few things:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Somewhat functional <b>Web Player</b> which uses PHP to scrape the '/player/videos' file folder and list all videos in it. It also includes a functional <b>Login</b> screen powered by <b>MySQL</b></li>
  <li>A little 'square catcher' game, that fully supports keyboard and gamepad input, powered by <b>Javascript Gamepad Api</b></li>
</ul>

Things I need to fix/add:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Generate thumbnails for the videos in the 'player' website</li>
  <li>Make the home page more intuitive and pretty</li>
  <li>Allow login from the homepage</li>
</ul>
